# Decimal Numbers

Now that we can make the bricks disappear on impact, we should probably get some reward, like points!
We'll start of with a score of 0 and then increase the score by 1 point each time a brick gets destroyed.
Then we can display the score on a scoreboard.

## Digit tiles

First we'll need to add some graphics for the numbers 0-9. We already have some ready-made digits for this project, so you can copy [this premade file](https://github.com/gbdev/gb-asm-tutorial/raw/master/unbricked/bcd/digit-tileset.asm), and paste it at the end of your tile set, just before the `TilesEnd` label. Your tile set will look like this:

![Screenshot of tile set with digits added at the end](../assets/part2/img/bcd-tileset.png)

So we can easily remember where the digits start, let's add a constant called `DIGIT_OFFSET` to point us to where the digits are relative to the start of the tile set: `$1A`

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:digit-offset}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:digit-offset}}
```

Let's make an assumption, that we cannot get a score higher than 99 ([what could possibly go wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem)) so two digits are enough.

We can start with showing two zeroes (the tile at offset `$1A`) on our initial map. Let's put them on row 3, starting 4 tiles to the left.
You can copy-paste the tile set from [this file](https://github.com/gbdev/gb-asm-tutorial/raw/master/unbricked/bcd/tilemap.asm)

This should make the tile set look like this on start up:

> **Tip:** You can find the address in VRAM in your emulator's tile map viewer by selecting the tile and looking at the index.
> The screenshot above is from emulucious.

Let's remember their positions by defining a constant for VRAM location of the 10s and the 1s at the top of our file, behind the other constants.

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:score-tile-location}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:score-tile-location}}
```

## BCD

As we're stingy when it comes to memory use, we will only use one byte. There are different ways of saving and retrieving numbers as decimals, but this time we will choose something called "Packed Binary Coded Decimal" or packed BCD for short.

BCD is a way of storing decimal numbers in bytes, not using A-F, so A would be 10 and would be the digits 1 and 0.

Remember how bits, nibbles and bytes work? [Hexadeciamal](../part1/bin_and_hex.md)
The "packed" part means that we pack 2 digits into one byte. A byte contains 8 bits and inside 4 bits we can already store numbers between `$0` (`%0000`) and `$F` (`%1111`), which is more than sufficent to store a number between 0 and 9. 

For example the number 35 (my favorite Pok√©mon) contains the number 3 `%0011` and 5 `%0101` and as a packed BCD would be `%00110101`

## Calculating the score

Now let's start by defining a global variable (memory location) for the score:

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:score-variable}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:score-variable}}
```

And we'll set this to zero when initializing the other global variables

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:init-variables}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:init-variables}}
```

Now we'll write a function to increase the score, right behind the `IsWallTile` function.
Don't worry about the call to `UpdateScoreBoard`, we'll get into that in a bit.

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:increase-score}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:increase-score}}
```

Let's have a look at what's going on there:
We set A to 1 and clear the carry flag
We add the score variable (contents of memory location `wScore`) to a, so now A has our increased score.

So far so good, but what if the score was 9 and we add 1? The processor thinks in binary only and will do the following math:

`%00001001` + `%00000001` = `%00001010` = `$A`

That's a hexadecimal representation of 10, and we need to adjust it to become decimal. `DAA` or "Decimal Adjust after Addition," does just that.
After executing `DAA` our accumulator will be adjusted from `%00001010` to `%00010000`; a 1 in the left nibble and a 0 in the right one. A more detailed article about `DAA` on the gameboy can be found [here](https://blog.ollien.com/posts/gb-daa/).

Then we store the score back into `wScore` and finally, we call a function that updates the score board.

Of course, we still need to call it on impact. To do this, we add a call to `IncreaseScorePackedBCD` after each collision handler (we had a left and a right collision) in `CheckAndHandleBrick`

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:handle-brick}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/bcd/main.asm:handle-brick}}
```
